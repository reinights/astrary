# Astrary

Astrary is a React + Three.js stargazing web application targeted to beginners to ease their process in getting to the hobby. It features a realistic night sky simulator, with star values gathered from https://codeberg.org/astronexus/hyg.

It also features a chatbot using Gemini, giving users the freedom to ask open-ended and miscalleanous questions about astronomy.

May your skies be clear, and your optics be clean.

## To-dos

- [ ] Completing textures in the night sky simulator for visual impact
- [ ] A telescope mode, so that users could test and figure out their equipment.
